The UserInputValidator class has a method called validate_positive_integers.

It takes a list of strings and returns only the ones that are positive integers.

It loops through each item, tries to convert it to an int, and if it works
and the number is greater than 0, it gets added to the result list.

If it cant convert it or its negative/zero, it just skips it.

Example: ["5", "-3", "hello", "10"] would return [5, 10]

There is also a display_validation_message method that prints a message
when a list has been validated.
